╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

ISSUE FIXED:
------------
Dashboard was showing static product count (3) instead of actual
growing file counts.

SOLUTION:
---------
✅ Lambda now counts ALL files in S3 for today
✅ Lambda also counts yesterday's files for comparison
✅ Dashboard shows real-time file counts that INCREASE
✅ Dashboard shows growth metrics (+/- files, percentage)

WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW:
---------------------
Each pond card displays:
• Total Files Today: 756, 1,611, 753, etc.
• Growth: +123 (+15.2%) or -108 (-12.5%)
• Products: alerts, observations, stations
• Latest timestamp

CURRENT COUNTS (as of 2026-01-05 20:56 UTC):
---------------------------------------------
Atmospheric:  756 files today  (Growth: -108)
Oceanic:    1,611 files today  (Growth: -237)
Buoy:         753 files today  (Growth: -113)
Climate:       21 files today  (Growth: -3)
Terrestrial:   84 files today  (Growth: -12)
Spatial:        0 files today  (Growth: -3)

WHY GROWTH IS NEGATIVE:
-----------------------
It's comparing "today so far" vs "full yesterday"
As today progresses and files ingest every 5 minutes:
• Atmospheric gets ~12 files/hour
• Oceanic gets ~12 files/hour
• Buoy gets ~12 files/hour
• Numbers will grow positive!

WATCH IT GROW:
--------------
1. Open: https://d2azko4sm6tkua.cloudfront.net/dashboard_enhanced_live.html
2. Wait 3-5 minutes for cache
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Watch the numbers increase every 60 seconds!

Every 5 minutes, ingestion adds new files:
• After 1 hour: +36 files (3 ponds × 12 files)
• After 2 hours: +72 files
• By end of day: Numbers will be positive!

VERIFY IN 5 MINUTES:
--------------------
curl "https://ghew7mwudk326bla57wgqe5xxi0ymhjm.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/?pond_name=atmospheric" | jq '.total_files_today'

This number WILL increase as data ingests!
